# 👋 Welcome to NextGen Devs Houston

**AI-powered coding workshops for kids. Preparing the next generation for the future.**

## 🎯 What We Do

We teach kids (ages 8-14) to build real games, apps, and websites using **GitHub Copilot** — the same AI tool used by professional developers at top tech companies.

Unlike traditional coding classes, your child creates something **real** in just 2-3 hours. No prior experience needed.

## 👨‍🏫 Your Instructor

**Hector Flores** — Senior Solutions Engineer at Microsoft, specializing in GitHub Copilot & AI. Hector runs AI workshops for Fortune 500 companies and is passionate about preparing the next generation for the future of software development.
